Bag of code I use and want to organize. Later I want divide it into a few repos

Apps contains applications and some tests

There is *com* package with common classes:
1. Algebra (Combinations, Permutaions, Expressions, quick-Maths, Matrix, Graphics2D)
2. Cryptography (Base64, AES, RSA, Primes, TLV)
3. Git (GitRepo-access git repo, GitGraph-generate git log as SVG)
4. Graph theory (Binary Tree, Heap Tree, Sorting)
5. IO (ScriptShell, Serial, IOText-utf8 i textstream)
6. NET (network classes from Sun, which implements FtpClient)
7. NetIO (non-blocking io with SelectorThread)
8. Puzzle solvers (Cryptarithms, Pentomino, PackRect, Sudoku)
9. SVG - primitives to generate vector graphics file
10. SYS - system tools
11. Text - conversted, ANSI codes
12. Time - calculate elapsed time
13. ui - user interface primiives
14. UnitTests - unit tests of *com*
15. img - image processing


There is *apps* package with application classes:
1. activity - activity measurement (in progress)
2. checker - parse file and check syntax (in progress)
3. crypt - pem file analizer, number generator, testcase generator
4. GFTP - git-ftp, send files tracked in git to remote server (deploy)
5. GitLog - save git log as svg graphics file
6. Puzzle solver/plaer apps - TicTacToe, Criptarithms, Pentomino, Sudoku, Rects
7. Remote desktop control (client & sever)
8. Serial - advanced terminal app
9. wgrep - Web Ggrep - grep-like app to scan www pages
